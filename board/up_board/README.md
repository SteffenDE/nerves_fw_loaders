# Firmware loader for UP Boards

This loader has been tested on the UP Board and the UP Core. The red, green, and
yellow LEDs on the bottom of the UP Board indicate progress. Yellow means that
the eMMC is being programmed (takes about 1-2 seconds). Green means that it's
done and you can remove the Flash drive. Red means that an error occurred and
you need to log into the device to see what happened. The UP core doesn't show
progress via LEDs.
